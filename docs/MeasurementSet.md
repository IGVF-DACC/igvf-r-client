# igvfclient::MeasurementSet

Measurement set is a file set that hosts raw data files (e.g. FASTQs) resulting from sequencing of a library prepared from the nucleic acids of the sample that is the main target of the assay. For example sequencing of accessible regions in the genome, or sequencing of the transcriptome of the sample. The assay can either be bulk or single cell type. The sample specific raw sequencing results will be captured in the measurement sets. The files in the measurement sets are specific to the sample being investigated. See auxiliary sets for files that are not a direct result of sequencing the sample under investigation.
